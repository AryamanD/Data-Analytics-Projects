# 🎬 Movies Dataset – Data Exploration (Python)

This project performs a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a movies dataset using Python. It involves inspecting, cleaning, and visualizing data to understand trends, correlations, and patterns within the film industry.

The goal is to demonstrate core data analysis skills using popular Python libraries and turn raw movie-related data into meaningful insights.

## 🔍 Key Tasks Performed

- Initial data inspection and structure review  
- Detection and removal of null/missing values  
- Data cleaning and preparation for analysis  
- Correlation matrix and heatmap generation  
- Visualizations using bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more
