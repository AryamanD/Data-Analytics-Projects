# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Exploration (SQL)

This project explores global COVID-19 data with a focus on analyzing **infection rates** and **vaccination progress** broken down by country. It utilizes structured SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.

The goal is to demonstrate SQL proficiency by transforming raw pandemic data into understandable metrics that reflect trends across countries and over time.

## 📊 Key Questions Answered

- What was the infection rate per country over time?  
- How did vaccination efforts progress across different regions?  
- What is the relationship between population size, cases, and vaccinations?

---

## 🧠 SQL Concepts Used

- `JOINS` (to merge infection and vaccination datasets)  
- `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` (for aggregation and sorting)  
- `WINDOW FUNCTIONS` (for cumulative analysis and trends over time)  
- `VIEWS` (to modularize and reuse complex queries)
